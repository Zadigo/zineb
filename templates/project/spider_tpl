"""
To start using Zineb:

    1. Create a class that derives from `zineb.app.Zineb`:

        class MySpider(Zineb):
            start_urls = []

            def start(self, response, request, soup, **kwargs):
                pass

    2. Register your spider in SPIDERS in the settings.py file

    3. Call `python manage.py start`

You can configure the way your project works by reading the 
relevant sections in your settings.py file.

For any other pieces of information on how to use Zineb
efficiently, please read https://github.com/Zadigo/zineb
