"""
To start using Zineb:

    1. Create a class that derives from `zineb.app.Zineb`:

        class MySpider(Zineb):
            start_urls = []

            def start(self, response, **kwargs):
                pass

    2. Register your spider in the SPIDERS parameter
       in your settings.py file

    3. Create model in the models.py file in order 
       to structure the scraped data from the internet

        class MyModel(Model):
            name = fields.CharField()

    3. Call `python manage.py start` to run your spiders

You can configure the way your project works by modifying the 
relevant sections of your settings.py file.
