"""
To start using Zineb:

    1. Create a class that derives from `zineb.app.Spider`:

        class MySpider(Spider):
            start_urls = []

            def start(self, response, request, **kwargs):
                pass

    2. Register your spider in the SPIDERS parameter
       in your settings.py file

    3. Create model in the models.py file to structure
       the scraped data

        class MyModel(Model):
            name = fields.CharField()

    3. Call `python manage.py start`

You can configure the way your project works by modifying the 
relevant sections of your settings file.
